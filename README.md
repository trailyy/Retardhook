Retardhook - Growtopia External Trainer

This is the source code of Retardhook, a Growtopia external trainer made in C#.
 
The whole thing was supposed to be a small project as back then i recently started cheating in Growtopia.
Project started in November 2020, then i met latrom/mortal and arky which helped me with the trainer.

You may be wondering, why am i releasing the source code of this trainer?
The answer is that i simply dont care and the overall code sucks cock.

I don't recommend selling this as your product because the protection is really poor and the whole program is really easy to reverse.

It was fun working on the project but you gotta move on.

Cheat features:
      - shit code
      - basic trainer features
      - shit wannabe p2c auth
      - overall the project is fucking garbage
      - antipaste ;DD
